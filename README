Hi ya All!

This tool can run on a linux based intel box with a smart array controller from Compaq. It reports status changes in the disks both to the syslog and to a snmp trap host.

The default is to only log to the syslog. You can specify traphosts with the -t parameter at the commandline. Multiple traphosts are allowed. It checks for valid input, but any errors are non-fatal, in fact the traphost is just ignored..

Questions, Comments and Bug can be reported to me, spark@knoware.nl.

I really like to hear from anybody who is using this.. Please sent both 
success and failure reports to me. 

Greetings and good luck!
