Hi ya All!

This tool can run on a linux based intel box with a smart array controller from Compaq. It reports status changes in the disks both to the syslog and to a snmp trap host.

The traphost is currently configured by changing the trap sending code. Just 
search for function sendtrap() (you need to change it at two locations) in 
the status.c file.

Questions, Comments and Bug can be reported to me, spark@knoware.nl.

I really like to hear from anybody who is using this.. Please sent both 
success and failure reports to me. 

Greetings and good luck!


Hugo
