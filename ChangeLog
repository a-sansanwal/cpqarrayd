Changes for version 1.2

* Included a patch from Ted Rule that improves the backgrounding of
  the cpqarrayd
* Tested if it compiles on 2.4.0, no changes are needed.


Changes for version 1.1

* Worked around the pid reporting problem in syslog,
  i just don't log it for now.
* New Card ID's added to the discover function. It should now 'see'
  the same cards as the SmartArray 1.0.6 driver.
* Fixed a bug in the sendtrap code. The pdu->agent_addr is now filled by 
  an internal function of ucd-snmp.


Changes before version 1.0

2000/08/10
----------
* Release of version 1.0

2000/02/11
----------
* Fixed a bug in the spec file

1999/12/28
----------
* Trap destinations are now a commandline options, default is no
  trap destination.
* Cleaned up the spec file and modified the build system. The application
  is installed in $prefix/sbin. RPM building seems to work, now i need some
  init scripts.
* Build some init scripts, install them as root with 'make install-redhat'.

1999/12/27
----------
* Added autoconf/automake support
* Few small bug fixes.
* The ip in the trap is now calculated..
* Added a do-not-fork commandline option.
* Created all the textfile which automake likes to see.

1999/12/20
----------
* Added syslog support, all events get logged to the syslog.
* BUG: pvalue value never got updated in the memory structs.
* Rewrote signal handlers, they no longer kill the daemon, instead
  they set a variable which makes the while loop terminate.

1999/12/07
----------
* Added a simple Makefile
* Added more debug code
* Added some memory of previous state to status funtions.
* Status now considers an initial state != 0 an error and sends a trap.
* Added two snmp variables to the trap: state and a description of the
  state.
* Also send a trap when the pvalue changes by more than 25%. This is keeps
  you informed of the progress of rebuilding and/or expanding.
* BUG: opts struct was not initialised with 0, giving false info on 
  commandline arguments.
* Most values for the snmptrap are now autodetected, the only thing left
  is the ip of the current host.

1999/12/02 
----------
* Wrote the discover code and made it fill memory structs when starting up.
  (based on the discover code in array-tool)
* The check4controllers function is obsolete and replaced by the generic
  discover function mentioned above.
* Added forking to the background and signal handling to kill the thing later.
* Added snmp code using the UCD-SNMP api to send traps. Not a nice api.
  I'm using a couple of fixed values for thing that should be detected.
* Wrote a function to monitor the status of the controller using the info
  provided by discover for fast scanning. 
  (based on the status function in array-tool)

1999/11/30  (tag: cpqarrayd-0_01)
----------
* Moved the code to CVS.
* At this point the code contains some commandline handling and a function 
  check4controlers to check if any controllers are available in the system.
